        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is about learning skills and knowledge. It also means helping people to
             learn how to do things and support them to think about what they learn. It's also important for educators to teach
              ways to find and use information. Education needs research to find out how to make it better.[1][2]

            Through education, the knowledge of society, country, and of the world is passed on from generation to generation. 
            This may include education in morality, for example learning how to act as loyal, honest and effective citizen.
            Education may help and guide individuals from one class to other. Educated individuals and groups can do things
             like, help less educated people and encourage them to get educated.</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Formal education is usually in school, where a person may learn basic,
             academic, or trade skills. Small children often attend a nursery or kindergarten but often formal education begins in 
             elementary school and continues with secondary school. Post-secondary education (or higher education) is usually at a 
             college or university which may grant an academic degree. Or, students may go to a City college where they learn practical skills.
              This way learners can become qualified to be plumbers, electricians, builders and similar occupations. 
              These course have arrangements for students to get practical experience. Apprenticeship was the older way to do this,
              Non-formal education includes adult basic education, adult literacy education or school equivalency preparation.
               In nonformal education someone (who is not in school) can learn literacy, other basic skills or job skills.

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge
             or fostering skills and character traits.
             These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
             of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that education results in an
             improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may
             also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. 
             Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly
             encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>
